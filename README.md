# ChARM (Cartoon &amp; Anime Rental Marketplace)

ChARM is a website containing a place to rent anime cosplay and other costumes

---

## Description

There are 2 accounts, namely admin, courier, and user

The admin's role is to manage user accounts and can also add and subtract costume items and can also view transaction status.
Users can register and log in and can choose and rent existing costumes, in the rental option they can choose to have the costumes delivered or picked up at the location. If you pick it up, it will issue the shop address. If you choose to deliver it to a certain place, it will enter the address where the user is located for delivery data.
Then the courier can receive orders from transactions that have been carried out and then update when the delivery is complete.

Additional Features: For rentals, available items can be displayed, then the user selects a product like a marketplace and can later checkout with several payment options.
There are two pick-up options, pick it up at the shop or send it to the respective place where you will then enter the address.

Revision: For the courier feature, WhatsApp API will be added to provide notifications to the courier for each order, then for costume components there will be a separate menu for full set costume rentals or just individual component rentals
